# AzureSearchTool
Use this tool to test out and debug search queries against the Azure Search REST API

Learn how to build queries and how the different parameters should be formatted.

After running the query, you can view all types of result sets returned; Primary Results, Facets, Query Suggestions, in addition to the actual raw response received from the Search service.

In addition you select different indexes, see stats and a lot more.

# Special Thanks
The tool is basically similar to the SharePoint Search Query Tool (https://sp2013searchtool.codeplex.com/) - many thanks for the idea!
